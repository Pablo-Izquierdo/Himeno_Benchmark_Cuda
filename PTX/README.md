# Himeno Benchmark on PTX assembly code

## HimenoPTX
Code writen by Pablo Izquierdo González.
On this code, the main functions (addgosa and main) are writen on PTX (assembly code of cuda) to run on nvidia gpu. 
The objective was try to optimize more the benchmark, trying to make the assembly code better thant de compiler (which it is quite difficult).
Note: After a long time debuging I wasn´t able to run it, due to a problem at compilation time.

## MatrixMulPTX
Example of PTX executable program that implementes a matrix multiplication.
