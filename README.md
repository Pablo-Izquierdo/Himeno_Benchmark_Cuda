# Himeno_Benchmark_Cuda

Himeno benchmark score is affected by the performance of a computer, especially memory band width.


In this repository, is shown the Himeno benchmark writen in differents lenguages.

The aim of this proyect was to implemente this benchmark to run on gpu. Also, see the speedup that can be obtain using the gpu instead of the cpu. Finnaly, see the differences between the parallel lenguages (Cuda, OpenACC) and try to optimize as much as posible (PTX).

On https://i.riken.jp/en/supercom/documents/himenobmt/ you can se information about the benchmarck and download the original code.

The graph represents the MFLOPS and Time depending on the size of the matixes, where you can see that cuda obtain better record.
